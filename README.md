# Roller-Madness-Game
Welcome to Roller Madness. It was made with the help of Michigan State University Introduction to Game Development on Coursera.org.  Use WASD or Arrows to move around!  You collect coins advance to level 2 where you have to try and last as long a possible, while dodging orange cubes! Be careful not to fall off of the edge of the floor, otherwise you will end up in the DEATHZONE!!! GLHF!  Thank you Michigan State University for putting the Introduction to Game Development online.
